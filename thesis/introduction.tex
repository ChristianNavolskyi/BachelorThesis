\section{Problem Statement}
With the growing digitalisation of the industry more data is available and can be used to improve production processes.
The amount of data created depends on the individual use case,
but still it needs to be stored to be useful.
Since there are multiple databases available it can be difficult to choose the right one for an individual scenario.

\subsection{Use Case - Industry 4.0}
There are multiple analytic algorithms to run on data to extract certain features.
In the industry those algorithms play an important role too,
but in this thesis we are looking at different aspects of the industrial use case,
mainly inserting data and reading data.

\subsubsection{Inserting Data}
\note{How is that used by the industry.}\newline
To digitalise the production processes the data produced by every machine in the production line should be stored for future analysis.
And to store that data it needs to be written into a database.
Since most factories running 24 hours a day the machines are producing a lot of data during the day.
That will be the base load for the underlying database, to store all that data from the production machines.

\subsubsection{Reading Data}
\note{How is that used by the industry.}\newline
Besides using the stored data for analysis algorithms,
simply reading data from the database is another common use case.
An example would be to get the time at which a specific product was processes by a specific machine to check if all parameters were set correctly.

\section{Question}
This thesis should give an answer to the question, if graph databases are suitable for an industrial application.
We concentrate on graph databases because of the structure of the production data.
Graphs and the use of graph databases are further motivated in section \ref{ch:background:se:industrialData} and section \ref{ch:background:se:graphDatabases} respectively.
