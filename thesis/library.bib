abstract = {Graphs are increasingly used in industry, governance, and science. This has stimulated the appearance of many and diverse graph-processing platforms. Although platform di- versity is beneficial, it alsomakes it very challenging to select the best platform for an application domain or one of its im- portant applications, and to design new and tune existing platforms. Continuing a long tradition of using benchmark- ing to address such challenges, in this work we present our vision for Graphalytics, a big data benchmark for graph- processing platforms. We have already benchmarked with Graphalytics a variety of popular platforms, such as Giraph, GraphX, and Neo4j.},

It consists of six deterministic algorithms, standard datasets, synthetic dataset generators, and reference output, that enable the objective comparison of graph analysis platforms. Its test harness produces deep metrics that quantify multiple kinds of system scalability, such as horizontal/vertical and weak/strong, and of robustness, such as failures and performance variability. The benchmark comes with opensource software for generating data and monitoring performance. We describe and analyze six implementations of the benchmark (three from the community, three from the industry), providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the platforms. Key to our contribution, vendors perform the tuning and benchmarking of their platforms.},

@article{Kim2012,
abstract = {Large scale real-world network data such as social and information networks are ubiquitous. The study of such social and information networks seeks to find patterns and explain their emergence through tractable models. In most networks, and especially in social networks, nodes have a rich set of attributes (e.g., age, gender) associated with them. Here we present a model that we refer to as the Multiplicative Attribute Graphs (MAG), which naturally captures the interactions between the network structure and the node attributes. We consider a model where each node has a vector of categorical latent attributes associated with it. The probability of an edge between a pair of nodes then depends on the product of individual attribute-attribute affinities. The model yields itself to mathematical analysis and we derive thresholds for the connectivity and the emergence of the giant connected component, and show that the model gives rise to networks with a constant diameter. We analyze the degree distribution to show that MAG model can produce networks with either log-normal or power-law degree distributions depending on certain conditions.},

abstract = {Link and graph analysis tools are important devices to boost the richness of information retrieval systems. Internet and the existing social networking portals are just a couple of situations where the use of these tools would be beneficial and enriching for the users and the analysts. However, the need for integrating different data sources and, even more important, the need for high performance generic tools, is at odds with the continuously growing size and number of data repositories. In this paper we propose and evaluate DEX, a high performance graph database querying system that allows for the integration of multiple data sources. DEX makes graph querying possible in different flavors, including link analysis, social network analysis, pattern recognition and keyword search. The richness of DEX shows up in the experiments that we carried out on the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). Through a variety of these complex analytical queries, DEX shows to be a generic and efficient tool on large graph databases.},

The target audience is a technologically inclined person with a background in software development. This document gives an overview of what Neo does and the benefits and drawbacks of using Neo in your application development. It will also try to give a glimpse of how Neo works and how developing with Neo is different from developing with a relational database. In a nut­shell, Neo is a robust, scalable, high­performance and embedded persistence engine for efficient management of semi­structured and network­oriented data. That's a lot of buzzwords! Let's have a closer look: • Neo is a database designed for network­oriented data. This is data that is ordered in complex networks or deep trees. Where the relational model is based on tables, columns and rows, Neo's primitives are nodes, relationships and properties. Together, these form a large network of information that we call a node space.},

abstract = {NoSQL is a database used to store high volume of data. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, distributed, open source and non-relational. High performance is a major concern for practically every data-driven system. NoSQL databases claim to deliver faster performance than the popular Relational database systems in various use cases, most notably those involving huge data. While this is always the case, it should be understood that not all NoSQL databases are created alike where performance is concerned. This being the case, IT professionals works hard to ensure that the database they select is optimized for the success of their application use cases. Such selection can be made in-house, based on tests with academic database benchmarks. We present the Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) framework, with the goal of facilitating performance comparisons of the new generation of NoSQL databases in an environment where resources are limited. Unlike many previous benchmarks that considered a cluster or distributed system that NoSQL is known for, we limit out experiment to a single PC assuming a cluster with a single node or a distributed system with a single PC. We define a core set of benchmarks and report results for four widely used systems: MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Redis, and OrientDB implementation.},

We describe the architecture of the XGDBench focusing on its importance for exascale clouds.We did a cluster analysis to compare the realistic nature of XGDBench data generator and saw that the community structures of synthetic graphs produced by XGDBench outperforms RMAT. We also conducted performance evaluation of four famous graph data stores AllegroGraph, Fuseki, Neo4j, an OrientDB using XGDBench on Tsubame 2.0 HPC cloud environment.},
