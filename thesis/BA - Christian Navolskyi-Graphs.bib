abstract = {There is much research on social network analysis but only recently did scholars turn their attention to the volatility of social networks. An abundance of questions emerged. How does a social network evolve – can we find laws and derive models that explain its evolution? How do communities emerge in a social network and how do they expand or shrink? What is a community in an evolving network – can we claim that two communities seen at two distinct timepoints are the same one, even if they have next to no members in common? Research advances have different perspectives: some scholars focus on how evolution manifests itself in a social network, while others investigate how individual communities evolve as new members join and old ones become inactive. There are methods for discovering communities and capturing their changes in time, and methods that consider a community as a smoothly evolving constellation and thus build and adapt models upon that premise. This survey organizes advances on evolution in social networks into a common framework and gives an overview of these different perspectives.},

abstract = {Abstract An RDF (Resource Description Framework) instance generator produces RDF triples by complying with an ontology that defines classes, subclasses, relations, and constraints. There aremany instance generatorswhich rely onWebOntology Language (OWL) meaning that these generators can read only the ontologies which are written in OWL. However, the existing generators are locked-in to a specific ontology, which means the generators can read only a specific ontology. For instance, the LUBM generator can read only the LUBM ontology, which is clearly a limitation as it is not able to read any other ontology such as biomodel ontology. This promotes the need for a generic RDF instance generator that is able to read and parse any ontology written in OWL. In this technical report, we describe a generic RDF instance generator. We de- velop this generator to enable users to use their own ontology to generate RDF triples which can be used to meet their specific needs. Keywords:},
