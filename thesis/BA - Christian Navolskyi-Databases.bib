abstract = {—Modern cloud providers offer dense hardware with multiple cores and large memories, hosted in global platforms. This raises the challenge of implementing high-performance software systems that can effectively scale from a single core to multicore to the globe. Conventional wisdom says that software designed for one scale point needs to be rewritten when scaling up by 10−100× [1]. In contrast, we explore how a system can be architected to scale across many orders of magnitude by design. We explore this challenge in the context of a new key-value store system called Anna: a partitioned, multi-mastered system that achieves high performance and elasticity via wait-free execution and coordination-free consistency. Our design rests on a simple architecture of coordination-free actors that perform state update via merge of lattice-based composite data structures. We demonstrate that a wide variety of consistency models can be elegantly implemented in this architecture with unprecedented consistency, smooth fine-grained elasticity, and performance that far exceeds the state of the art.},

abstract = {The limitations of traditional databases, in particular the relational model, to cover the requirements of current applications has lead the development of new database technologies. Among them, the Graph Databases are calling the attention of the database community because in trendy projects where a database is needed, the extraction of worthy information relies on processing the graph-like structure of the data. In this paper we present a systematic comparison of current graph database models. Our review includes general features (for data storing and querying), data modeling features (i.e., data structures, query languages, and integrity constraints), and the support for essential graph queries.},
