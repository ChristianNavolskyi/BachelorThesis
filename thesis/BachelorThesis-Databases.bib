@misc{W3C2014,
abstract = {In addition to the classic “Web of documents” W3C is helping to build a technology stack to support a “Web of data,” the sort of data you find in databases. The ultimate goal of the Web of data is to enable computers to do more useful work and to develop systems that can support trusted interactions over the network. The term “Semantic Web” refers to W3C's vision of the Web of linked data. Semantic Web technologies enable people to create data stores on the Web, build vocabularies, and write rules for handling data. Linked data are empowered by technologies such as RDF, SPARQL, JSON-LD, OWL, and SKOS.},

@article{Angles2012a,
abstract = {The limitations of traditional databases, in particular the relational model, to cover the requirements of current applications has lead the development of new database technologies. Among them, the Graph Databases are calling the attention of the database community because in trendy projects where a database is needed, the extraction of worthy information relies on processing the graph-like structure of the data. In this paper we present a systematic comparison of current graph database models. Our review includes general features (for data storing and querying), data modeling features (i.e., data structures, query languages, and integrity constraints), and the support for essential graph queries.},
